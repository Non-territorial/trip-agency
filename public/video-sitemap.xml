                    <video:title>(Un)disclosed | Experience as an Exhibition</video:title>
                    <video:description>On the remote Sicilian island of Salina, (UN)DISCLOSED unfolds. This is no ordinary exhibition. It’s a journey, a discovery, a live art experience that transforms into something entirely unprecedented. The experience is distributed, with exhibitions woven into the island’s secluded spaces. Upon arrival, you’ll receive a map — a guide to the undisclosed, an invitation to explore the island at your own pace. There are no tour guides, no fixed routes, only the freedom to discover, interpret, and experience the unexpected. Each location holds its own secret: sonic, cinematic, conceptual installations, and site-specific works that challenge the boundaries of space and time. The program evolves, with certain moments and locations revealed only when the time is right. A hotel, your place of rest, becomes part of the exhibition itself. (UN)DISCLOSED asks for your time, your curiosity, and your willingness to see beyond the surface. It’s not just an exhibition but an experience as a whole through art and the self, bound together by the rhythms of an island waiting to be discovered.

Accommodation: 4-day, 3-night stay in a boutique hotel with oceanfront views and private beach. Culinary Experiences: Daily breakfast at the hotel and lunch and dinners at local restaurants. Curated wine pairings with each meal. Audiovisual Experience: Permanent audiovisual installations across the island, active throughout the stay.
